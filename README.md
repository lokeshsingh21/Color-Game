# Color-Game
A Front-end project aka Color Guessing Game for understanding the RGB Color Model built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The objective of the game is to guess which of these squares matches the displayed RGB color value at the top of the screen. Features "Easy" and "Hard" modes, the former producing 3 squares varying in color and the latter featuring 6 squares.
